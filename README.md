# SaaS PoS Growth Analytics Project â€” PointX

A data analytics portfolio project focusing on SaaS business performance for Point-of-Sale providers in Jordan.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem
Management lacks a unified view of subscription health and growth efficiency. We are unsure which customer segments are the most profitable, whether revenue is growing organically from existing merchants, and if acquisition investments justify long-term value.  
This leads to inefficient resource allocation and missed churn warnings.

## âœ… Project Goals
- Measure growth efficiency (MRR, NRR)
- Understand segment profitability (Industry, Region, Plan, Channel)
- Analyze churn patterns and early-warning signals
- Link CAC to retention and merchant value
